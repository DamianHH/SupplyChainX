# SupplyChainX: Revolutionizing Global Supply Chains with OPEN SOURCE Smart Contracts

Lack of transparency, product authenticity, and regulatory compliance in global supply chains leads to inefficiencies, counterfeiting, and high operational costs across industries.

SupplyChainX will leverage Aiken's smart contracts on Cardano to provide transparent, secure, and open source traceability for global supply chains.

SupplyChainX will be an open-source platform leveraging Aikenâ€™s smart contracts on Cardano to bring transparency, security, and efficiency to global supply chains. Using blockchain and NFTs, SupplyChainX enables real-time product traceability from origin to consumer, ensuring product authenticity, reducing fraud, and facilitating regulatory compliance. Each product or batch will be represented as an NFT, allowing stakeholders across industries like pharmaceuticals, food, luxury goods, and medical devices to track and verify product movement and origin securely. The platform also automates processes that are traditionally manual, minimizing errors and reducing operational costs.
